## Introduction

This chart deploys the NGINX Gateway Fabric in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- [Helm 3.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

### Installing the Gateway API resources

> [!NOTE]
>
> The [Gateway API resources](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api) from the standard channel must be
> installed before deploying NGINX Gateway Fabric. If they are already installed in your cluster, please ensure
> they are the correct version as supported by the NGINX Gateway Fabric -
> [see the Technical Specifications](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/blob/main/README.md#technical-specifications).

```shell
kubectl kustomize https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/config/crd/gateway-api/standard | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>= 1.25.0-0`

## Installing the Chart

### Installing the Chart from the OCI Registry

To install the latest stable release of NGINX Gateway Fabric in the `nginx-gateway` namespace, run the following command:

```shell
helm install ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginx/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway
```

`ngf` is the name of the release, and can be changed to any name you want. This name is added as a prefix to the Deployment name.

If the namespace already exists, you can omit the optional `--create-namespace` flag. If you want the latest version from the `main` branch, add `--version 0.0.0-edge` to your install command.

To wait for the Deployment to be ready, you can either add the `--wait` flag to the `helm install` command, or run
the following after installing:

```shell
kubectl wait --timeout=5m -n nginx-gateway deployment/ngf-nginx-gateway-fabric --for=condition=Available
```

### Installing the Chart via Sources

#### Pulling the Chart

```shell
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/nginx/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --untar
cd nginx-gateway-fabric
```

This will pull the latest stable release. To pull the latest version from the `main` branch, specify the
`--version 0.0.0-edge` flag when pulling.

#### Installing the Chart

To install the chart into the `nginx-gateway` namespace, run the following command.

```shell
helm install ngf . --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway
```

`ngf` is the name of the release, and can be changed to any name you want. This name is added as a prefix to the Deployment name.

If the namespace already exists, you can omit the optional `--create-namespace` flag.

To wait for the Deployment to be ready, you can either add the `--wait` flag to the `helm install` command, or run
the following after installing:

```shell
kubectl wait --timeout=5m -n nginx-gateway deployment/ngf-nginx-gateway-fabric --for=condition=Available
```

### Custom installation options

#### Service type

By default, the NGINX Gateway Fabric helm chart deploys a LoadBalancer Service.

To use a NodePort Service instead:

```shell
helm install ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginx/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway --set nginx.service.type=NodePort
```

## Upgrading the Chart

> [!NOTE]
>
> See [below](#configure-delayed-termination-for-zero-downtime-upgrades) for instructions on how to configure delayed
> termination if required for zero downtime upgrades in your environment.

### Upgrading the Gateway Resources

Before you upgrade a release, ensure the Gateway API resources are the correct version as supported by the NGINX
Gateway Fabric - [see the Technical Specifications](../../README.md#technical-specifications).:

To upgrade the Gateway CRDs from [the Gateway API repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api), run:

```shell
kubectl kustomize https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/config/crd/gateway-api/standard | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Upgrading the CRDs

Helm does not upgrade the NGINX Gateway Fabric CRDs during a release upgrade. Before you upgrade a release, you
must [pull the chart](#pulling-the-chart) from GitHub and run the following command to upgrade the CRDs:

```shell
kubectl apply --server-side -f crds/
```

The following warning is expected and can be ignored:

```text
Warning: kubectl apply should be used on resource created by either kubectl create --save-config or kubectl apply.
```

### Upgrading the Chart from the OCI Registry

To upgrade the release `ngf`, run:

```shell
helm upgrade ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginx/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric -n nginx-gateway
```

This will upgrade to the latest stable release. To upgrade to the latest version from the `main` branch, specify
the `--version 0.0.0-edge` flag when upgrading.

### Upgrading the Chart from the Sources

Pull the chart sources as described in [Pulling the Chart](#pulling-the-chart), if not already present. Then, to upgrade
the release `ngf`, run:

```shell
helm upgrade ngf . -n nginx-gateway
```

### Configure Delayed Termination for Zero Downtime Upgrades

To achieve zero downtime upgrades (meaning clients will not see any interruption in traffic while a rolling upgrade is
being performed on NGF), you may need to configure delayed termination on the NGF Pod, depending on your environment.

> [!NOTE]
>
> When proxying Websocket or any long-lived connections, NGINX will not terminate until that connection is closed
> by either the client or the backend. This means that unless all those connections are closed by clients/backends
> before or during an upgrade, NGINX will not terminate, which means Kubernetes will kill NGINX. As a result, the
> clients will see the connections abruptly closed and thus experience downtime.

1. Add `lifecycle` to both the nginx and the nginx-gateway container definition. To do so, update your `values.yaml`
   file to include the following (update the `sleep` values to what is required in your environment):

   ```yaml
    nginxGateway:
        <...>
        lifecycle:
            preStop:
                exec:
                    command:
                    - /usr/bin/gateway
                    - sleep
                    - --duration=40s # This flag is optional, the default is 30s

    nginx:
        <...>
        lifecycle:
            preStop:
                exec:
                    command:
                    - /bin/sleep
                    - "40"
   ```

2. Ensure the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` matches or exceeds the `sleep` value from the `preStopHook` (the default
   is 30). This is to ensure Kubernetes does not terminate the Pod before the `preStopHook` is complete. To do so,
   update your `values.yaml` file to include the following (update the value to what is required in your environment):

   ```yaml
   terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 50
   ```

> [!NOTE]
>
> More information on container lifecycle hooks can be found in the official
> [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks) and a detailed
> description of Pod termination behavior can be found in
> [Termination of Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/Pods/Pod-lifecycle/#Pod-termination).

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the release `ngf`:

```shell
helm uninstall ngf -n nginx-gateway
kubectl delete ns nginx-gateway
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/main/deploy/crds.yaml
```

These commands remove all the Kubernetes components associated with the release and deletes the release.

### Uninstalling the Gateway Resources

> **Warning: This command will delete all the corresponding custom resources in your cluster across all namespaces!
> Please ensure there are no custom resources that you want to keep and there are no other Gateway API implementations
> running in the cluster!**

To delete the Gateway API CRDs from [the Gateway API repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api), run:

```shell
kubectl kustomize https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/config/crd/gateway-api/standard | kubectl delete -f -
```
